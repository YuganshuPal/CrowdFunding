CROWD FUNDING THROUGH SMART CONTRACTS

This smart contract is created on REMIX.
It immitates the very basic working of a crowd funding round but in a more secure and trustworthy way of blockchain.

Through this smart contract a funding manager can receive the funding from different people or entities in the form of ETH. Smart Contract ensures that the funding is only given to the cause which is favoured by the majority and give voting rights to the donors. If the deadline for fund raising is passed and the target amount is not reached the smart contract automatically returns the amount to the donors wallet ensuring the ethics. Also if the majority rules out the possibilty of funding for a project then also the amount returns to the donors amount. The smart contract also ensures that the amount goes to the wallet linked to the cause only.
